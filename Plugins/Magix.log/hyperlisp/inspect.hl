in addition, the log item will automatically store the date and time for when 
the item was logged

both [header] and [body] can contain string formatting parameters.  this means 
that if you supply children nodes to either header or body, then these will be 
possible to reference inside your header or body value by using {0} to reference 
the first item, {1} to reference the second.  with this, you can combine your text 
to header or body with parameters that will be substituded inside of the value 
of header or body

all parameters can be either constants or expressions"
