<p>magix is mvc, without model.&nbsp;&nbsp;many have legacy data, these can wrap 
existing business code to active controllers, and become dynamic.&nbsp;&nbsp;to kill 
disease, is to slowly cure the rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;don't kill disease, let the healthy 
body replace the sick</p>

<p>this way legacy is safe, nobody sees dirty deeds, you keep job, and 
ceo keep face.&nbsp;&nbsp;everybody happy, you go vacation thailand</p>

<ul>
<li>no model - db4o support included</li>
<li>controller - active controller</li>
<li>view - active modules</li>
</ul>

<p>active events ties together modules and controllers, allowing them to communicate.&nbsp;&nbsp;
by using active events to communicate, no link between module and controller exists, and
flexibility is acquired.&nbsp;&nbsp;existing legacy model-code can be attached to controllers, 
minimizing influence of sick code, slowly curing by substitution</p>
