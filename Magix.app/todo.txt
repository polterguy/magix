* when a form is injected into a page, and it has a lambda control, it disregards the fact that oncreatecontrols
  is only to be run once, and not upon ajax callbacks. the behavior in the DynamicForm class is correct,
  while the HtmlViewer seems to go bananas, something that can be seen by previewing form in forms editor
  and adding a show message box in the lambda oncreatecontrols, and create an ajax callback anyway, and see how the form is not re-initialized,
  while in a page, with a page get paramater, the same form will show the same messagebox upon every single ajax request.
  sever error!!

* there are no way to traverse trees, hierarchically, currently in magix. this is seen if attempting to construct a tree 
  lamba web control of e.g. namespaces in magix, represented as a tree

* something is very fishy with the admin settings form, it keeps on flashing the scheck boxes randomly off and on ...?
