
<h2>ajax - mux</h2>

<p>magix contains an ajax library which is called mux. mux is as acronym, and means magix user experience. mux is built 
around a concept called managed ajax, which is in most regards far superior to for instance asp.net ajax. first of 
all, the syntax is the same syntax as the asp.net postback web controls, which means it's easier to learn and use 
than asp.net ajax. secondly, mux uses far less bandwith than asp.net ajax in its requests to the server, since 
asp.net ajax is largely reliant upon partial rendering, where mux is largely not dependent upon this. thirdly, 
the javascript library files for mux, is a fraction of the size of the javascript files for asp.net ajax. though 
the most important feature of mux, is that javascript knowledge is optional! you do not need to know anything 
about javascript to create very rich and advanced ajax applications with mux!</p>

<p>if you compare mux with other ajax libraries, such as jquery, telerik and such, you will find that mux 
scores better than all of these libraries in regards to most parameters. with mux, ajax just happens!</p>

<p>if you're used to using web controls from asp.net, then mux should be very familiar to you. in fact the 
only difference is that instead of using &lt;asp: you use &lt;mux: when declaring your web controls. and in the 
codebehind of your aspx and ascx file, you will be using the Magix.UX namespace instead of System.Web.UI 
namespace. besides from that, the api is the same, except for of course, that mux has support for many things 
that the conventional web control libraries does not have</p>

<p>below is an example of an active module, using mux instead of conventional web controls. remember to embed 
the active module as an embedded resource if you attempt to try to compile this sample</p>

<label>SampleModule.ascx</label>
<pre>
&lt;%@ Assembly 
    Name="Magix.sample" %&gt;
&lt;%@ Control 
    Language="C#" 
    AutoEventWireup="true" 
    Inherits="Magix.sample.SampleModule" %&gt;

&lt;mux:Button
    runat="server"
    id="btn"
    OnClick="btn_Click"
    Text="Click Me!"
    CssClass="span-3 btn-large"/&gt;

&lt;mux:Label
    runat="server"
    id="lbl"
    Text="to be changed ..."
    OnMouseOver="lbl_MouseOver"
    CssClass="span-5"/&gt;
</pre>

<label>SampleModule.ascx.cs</label>
<pre>
using System;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using Magix.Core;
using Magix.UX.Widgets;

namespace Magix.sample
{
    public class SampleModule : ActiveModule
    {
        protected Button btn;
        protected Label lbl;

        protected void btn_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            lbl.Text ="label text was changed!";
        }

        protected void lbl_MouseOver(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            lbl.Text ="DON'T TOUCH ME!!! OUCH!";
        }
    }
}</pre>

<p>with the conventional asp.net web controls, you can mostly handle the click events and such on the server. with 
mux, you can virtually handle all dom events that exists, in event handlers on the server, from where you can 
modify all other mux controls as you wish, in ajax callbacks. this facilitates for a much cleaner architecture for 
your solutions, where all the business logic ends up on the server, and doesn't end up leaking out into the 
client environment in your browser environment</p>

<p>you will find most controls you need in the Magix.UX namespace from the Magix.UX project. however, below 
is an exhaustive list</p>

<ul>
<li>Button</li>
<li>CheckBox</li>
<li>HiddenField</li>
<li>HyperLink</li>
<li>Image</li>
<li>Label</li>
<li>LinkButton</li>
<li>Panel</li>
<li>RadioButton</li>
<li>SelectList</li>
<li>TextArea</li>
<li>TextBox</li>
<li>DynamicPanel</li>
<li>Timer</li>
<li>Uploader</li>
<li>Wysiwyg</li>
</ul>
