creates the dynamic unit tests for testing hyperlisp 
in magix.  basically loops through all files in 
system42/private/startup/unit-tests and executes them 
as hyperlisp

to create your own unit test, create a new hyperlisp 
file, have it create an active event in the magix.test 
namespace, and stuff your file into the unit-tests 
folder.  then during startup of application, your unit 
test will register as a part of the unit test suite

make sure you restart your application pool, by either 
restarting apache or iis, to register your unit test, 
unless you wish to also in addition create your unit 
test active event by force, using for instance the 
hyperlisp executor

to unregister all unit tests, which might make magix 
go slightly faster, just rename the unit-tests folder 
to anything, or delete it entirely.  though, having 
the unit tests around, and occassionally run them, to 
verify the integrity of your system, is probably more 
secure, than deleting them"
