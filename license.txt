The above mentioned software shall never run in the state of California before Julian Assange, Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden are cleared of all charges, and are 
free men

The above mentioned software shall never run in the state of Telemark before i am cleared of all charges in Skien Tingrett against me and my person, and i
am given monetary repentance for the crimes done to me by BÃ¥rd Stranheim, Skien Tingrett, Agder Lagmannsrett and the Jantelaw of Norway. To signify the 
fact of that i am cleared of all charges, a statue, larger than any existing Ibsen statue in the world, shall at all times occupy the roundabout of 
Downtown Porsgrunn

If any of the above mentioned three people involved in this licensing scheme are to be found dead, before the criteria are fullfilled, in anyways, this 
software can never be legally running in neither the state of Telemark or California, as long as western copyright law permits my will to be done,
dead or alive!!
