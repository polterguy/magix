<h2>the file system</h2>

<p>from the <em>"file system"</em> link on your dashboard, you can access all files in your magix installation.&nbsp;&nbsp;it 
also allows you to edit and modify some file types, such as css and text files, in addition to that it allows you to upload new 
files</p>

<p>if you wish to upload one or more files to your server, you first browse to whatever folder you wish to upload these files to, 
then you can just drag and drop files from your desktop machine, and onto your browser area, and the files will be automatically uploaded</p>

<p>you can also create new files from the files system, such as text files, or css files.&nbsp;&nbsp;in addition, you can delete 
files through the file system.&nbsp;&nbsp;files which cannot be edited directly through magix, such as images and such, will be 
opened up and viewed instead of edited.&nbsp;&nbsp;in addition, you can also create, delete and rename both directories and 
files from the file system link</p>

<p>you can think of the file system link as your magix' version of the windows explorer, if you wish</p>
