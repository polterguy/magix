<p>all of this can be transported over the web.&nbsp;&nbsp;meaning one server can build code, that
another server runs, with callbacks to the first.&nbsp;&nbsp;this way you can partition your network
as non-homogenously as you could possible dream of</p>

<p>you could have one "magix.execute.if" server, and another "magix.execute.else" server</p>

<p>this is possible due to no concept.&nbsp;&nbsp;magix is an empty cup, everything else json.&nbsp;&nbsp;
magix.execute code is nothing but a node tree, the seeds of json</p>
