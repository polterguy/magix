unit tests.  if some parts of the active event throws an exception, then the 
test will be considered failing, and a red message box will show.  if no test 
fails, the message box will be green, and it will show the number of tests 
which have been running.  to create a new unit test, create an active event 
handler, that is within the magix.test namespace, and it will automatically 
register as a part of the test-suite, which is to be executed, as this active 
event is raised.  if one unit test fails, it will abort all other tests, and 
show you the name of the active event that failed
