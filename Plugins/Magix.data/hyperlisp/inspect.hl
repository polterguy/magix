creates a database transaction.  unless [magix.data.commit] is raised before the scope of the 
transaction ends somehow, all changes done to the database inside of the transaction will be 
rolled back, and discarded.  this is useful to make sure a long operation is successful as a 
whole to allow changes to the database

if a transaction is active, no other threads will be able to access the database, and will 
have to wait for the transaction to finish, before they're allowed to read and write to and 
from the database

magix.data.load-dox=>@"loads a node from database

loads the first object matching the given [id] or the given [prototype].  it will return all 
objects matching your prototype if you supply a prototype node.  or the object matching your 
id if you supply an id.  if neither prototype nor id is given, it will load all objects from 
database

if you supply a prototype, it will return objects found as [objects], with child nodes of 
[objects] being the matching objects.  if you supply an [id] node, it will return the matched 
object as [value]

in addition to loading the actual object and its id(s), [revision-count] and [created] will 
also be returned for all objects matching your criteria.  [revision-count] is the number of 
times the object has been saved, and [created] is the date and time of creation of your object

if you supply a [prototype] and an [only-id], then only the ids, [revision-count] and [created] 
values of the objects that matches your prototype will be loaded, and not the actual content of 
your object

use [start] and [end] to fetch a specific slice of objects, [start] defaults to 0 and [end] defaults 
to -1, which means all objects matching criteria.  [start], [end] and [prototype] cannot be defined 
if [id] is given, since [id] is unique, and will make sure only one object is loaded

if a [prototype] node is given, it can contain node values with % to signify wildcards for a match 
operation.  to search for something actually containing a percentage sign '%', use two percentage 
signs to signify you're looking for one percentage sign like this '%%'

both [id], [prototype], [start] and [end] can be either constant values, nodes or expressions 
pointing to an id or a prototype object, which will be used as the criteria to load objects.  
no nodes in prototype can contain neither formatting values, nor expressions, since the [prototype] 
node is not evaluated in any form before being passed into the match algorithm

[id], if given,  can contains formatting expressions, such as {0}, {1} and so on, de-referencing 
children nodes of [id]

and returned as [id].  if an [id] is given, and an object with that same id exists, the 
existing object will be overwritten and updated.  both [value] and [id] can be either 
expressions or constant strings or nodes.  if [value] is an expression, it will be used as 
an expression pointing to a node that is to be saved, and the children node of the node 
pointed to in the expression of [value] are saved as the value of the object.  if [value] 
is an expression, it must be an expression returning a node list

given, you cannot supply a prototype.  if you supply a prototype, then no id can be 
supplied.  if you supply a prototype, you can use wildcard comparisons by using '%' 
as a wildcard equality comparison.  to search for a percentage sign, use two percentage 
signs to signify you're looking for one, like this '%%'
